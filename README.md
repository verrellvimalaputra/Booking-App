Welcome to my small Campus Project!!!
It is a Booking App with a very simple UI (which not so pretty to be seen by a customer) developed in C++.
This App contains some functionality you can try out, such as reading a booking data in json, search for a customer, add a new booking for the customer, show the location of a certain place from the booking in map, and many more.
But yeah this app is still far from perfect, but it was pretty exciting to work on this project.
Cheers out!
